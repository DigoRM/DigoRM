Hi, my name is Rodrigo Rodrigues Marcolino. 
I'm graduated on Production Engineering in 2019. Since then, I dedicated myself to learn a computer language to upgrade my skils and stand out on this competitive job market.
Here I upload every course, challenges and projects I did envolving python and other computer languages.
As an engineering, I enjoy to work with data science projects, envolving mainly computer skills, business inteligence and assertive communication with stakeholders.
I consider these habilities extremely important to promove insights, point new directions and create innovative solutions based on exploratory data analysis, machine learning and artificial inteligence
