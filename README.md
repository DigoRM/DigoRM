Hi, my name is Rodrigo Rodrigues Marcolino. 
I'm graduated on Production Engineering in 2019. Since then, I dedicated myself to learn a computer language to upgrade my skils and stand out on this competitive job market.
Here I upload every course, challenges and projects I did envolving python and other computer languages.
At this moment, I'm specializing myself in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence, as you can see on my repositories :) 

This is my Linkedin Profile with detailed informations of my carreer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-rodrigues-marcolino-aa1a3617a/
